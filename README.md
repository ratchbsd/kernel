Libre Kernel
===========

We're branded as RatchBSD. Please note, we are not connected to BSD in any way.

The Libre Kernel is based on the Linux Kernel and the FreeBSD Operating System, while not copying any code, we use it 
heavily as inspiration source.
Whilst maintaing our packages and kernel-features, you may notice some issues. Please report those to us. Your 
feedback is very valuable.

We have various text files regarding documentation, those are located within the Documentation/ subdirectory.
Several of them are using our own documentation language, which was then compiled to HTML.

For any suggestions, you can email us with the email we will be placing here soon. Please know that this project is 
in very early phases. And is not ready for anything. We're starting this project as of 24/10/25.

We will put a high-level overview here, in the future.
