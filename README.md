Libre Kernel
===========

We're branded as RatchBSD. Please note, we are not connected to BSD in any way.

The Libre Kernel is based on the Linux Kernel and the FreeBSD Operating System, while not copying any code, we use it 
heavily as inspiration source.
Whilst maintaing our packages and kernel-features, you may notice some issues. Please report those to us. Your 
feedback is very valuable.

We have various text files regarding documentation, those are located within the Documentation/ subdirectory.
Several of them are using our own documentation language, which was then compiled to HTML.

For any suggestions, you can email us with the email we will be placing here soon. Please know that this project is 
in very early phases. And is not ready for anything. We're starting this project as of 24/10/25.

We will put a high-level overview here, in the future.

## Story

I was looking for a proper operating-system for development, tinkering and server use. There was FreeBSD and Linux, 
those were the most viable options. Yet when i started to tinker with hardware, i noticed i wanted something else, 
fully custom, full control. Then i started to think about RatchBSD, a name i had in my mind for awhile. I thought, 
what if i personally made an operating-system, combining Linux and FreeBSD, but also making unique touches ? Well, 
that is exactly what i did. I started this project for people who are like me, always thinking about the best options, 
about having fun and full control over their hardware.

Everyone is welcome to work on this operating system, i made it for everyone, for the community and for daily uses. Of 
course, it is not done at all. I would not recommend to use it for anything now. At the moment of writing this, there 
is not even a single code-file included, just this readme. We want everyone to be involved, i want to build a massive 
community, and the best part; You don't need to know any code, if you can design, moderate or anything really, you can 
join us in the journey. I will put contact information below at a later time, using this, contact me and ask for a 
position in this project.

## Technical Overview

We're planning to use a similar structure like the FreeBSD source-code, but with a massive twist. What annoys me about 
the FreeBSD source-code, is that you have something like sys/sys, i just can't seem  to figure out why, or what the 
purpose would be. Of course, that is my personal opinion. But we are doing it with a twist. If anyone has any 
suggestions for a source-tree, contact me at the email at the very end of this readme.

## Live Streaming

A lot of this project, even the bad sides, will be live-streamed. Like this we can chat with the community and learn 
together. If i am very honest, i am new to operating-system development, so doing it with the community is the best 
thing to do, both to learn and to have fun. Everyone is welcome. The YouTube, Twitch and X (twitter) will be linked 
below. We're going to start streaming whenever we are ready to touch some code. Which will be very soon. Maybe even 
the same day as the initial commit.

## Development Platform

I personally use 2 main systems, one is running MacOS and the other one runs Ubuntu. Like this, i try to make guides 
and compile guides easier for everyone. Currently, this is being done on MacOS, but will be ported and compiled on 
Ubuntu as well. It really depends on whatever i feel like doing, and if i am on the go or just at my desk. Regardless, 
this is for everyone. Do not worry about your operating-system, at all. You'll be fine.

We will possibly have 2 seperate folders, for compiling. One with scripts and tools for MacOS and one for Linux.
